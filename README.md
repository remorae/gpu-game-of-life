# GPU Game of Life
A graphical depiction of Conway’s Game of Life written in C++.

## Features
* [x] Pause and un-pause the simulation
* [ ] Click on cells to toggle their state
* [x] Pan the grid
* [x] Zoom in and out
* [x] Clear the existing grid
* [x] Randomize the existing grid
* [x] Display current UPS/FPS
* [ ] Pre-built test cases
* [ ] Stretch Goal: Control the speed of the simulation
* [ ] Stretch Goal: Deploy “templates” of commonly-known entities in the Game of Life, e.g. gliders

## Implementation Details
All update operations will occur on the GPU. This will allow for huge grid sizes to be updated quickly. Ideally, along with tile-based kernel configuration, we will divide the grid into “chunks” and only update portions that have any alive cells for maximum performance.
